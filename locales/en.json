      "method1Title": "Most reliable method: use body heat",
      "method1": "When the sun is hidden, wind is low and no external heat source is available, the best way to dry clothes is to use your own body heat. Prepare wet garments by wringing them out as much as possible, put a dry layer next to your skin, then tuck the damp item under your jacket or fleece so your body heat slowly evaporates the moisture. This works especially well for small items such as gloves, socks and buffs.",
      "method2Title": "Drying inside the tent: possible but not automatically effective",
      "method2": "Suspending clothes inside a tent often fails because tents trap humid air and cause condensation. If you must dry inside, hang garments high, avoid touching the walls, and use vents to encourage airflow. When rain eases, open a small vent to create a slight cross-breeze.",
      "method3Title": "Use camp heat safely",
      "method3": "Camp kitchens are warmer areas that can speed drying. Keep garments at a safe distance from flames (at least 1m) and turn them regularly. A perforated plastic bag can act as a mini-greenhouse to concentrate gentle heat around the fabric.",
      "method4Title": "The emergency dry-bag",
      "method4": "Pack a sealed dry-bag with a spare set of essential clothing (base layer, socks, t-shirt) that you never wear during the day. This 'insurance' kit lets you change into dry clothes after a long wet day and preserves core warmth at night.",
      "method5Title": "Exploit wind and respites",
      "method5": "Short pauses when rain eases or a gust of wind can be enough to dry small items. Stretch garments open to increase surface area and expose them to airflow — even ten minutes can significantly reduce dampness.",
      "mistakesTitle": "Common mistakes and how to avoid them",
      "mistakes": "Washing clothes on trek is often counterproductive in cold, humid mountain conditions. Laying garments on wet ground or pressing them against tent walls will slow drying and increase humidity problems. Walking in wet garments against skin increases heat loss and friction injuries.",
      "conclusionTitle": "Conclusion: rain isn't the enemy, humidity is",
      "conclusion": "With simple techniques — body heat, camp heat, wind and a dry-bag — you can manage moisture and stay comfortable on a wet trek. Anticipation and small habits make the difference between a miserable journey and an enjoyable adventure.",

      "meta": { "author": "Kilimanjaro Local Guide", "date": "December 2025", "readingTime": "8 min read" },
      "sections": {
        "overview": { "title": "How to prepare your body for Kilimanjaro's altitude", "content": "Altitude is the main challenge when climbing Kilimanjaro and the biggest factor affecting summit success. From around 3,000 meters, the amount of oxygen in the air decreases gradually. The body must adapt to this lower oxygen level to continue functioning normally.\n\nUnlike physical fitness, altitude cannot be \"trained\" in a gym. A very fit person can still struggle at altitude. Success on Kilimanjaro therefore depends on good acclimatization, a suitable pace, strict hydration, and responsible behaviour in the mountains.\n\nAs a local guide I see each season that people who respect the altitude have far greater chances of reaching the summit than those who underestimate it." },
        "how-body-reacts": { "title": "How the body reacts to altitude", "content": "At altitude, the body receives less oxygen with each breath. To compensate, the heart rate increases and breathing becomes faster. This is a natural and normal reaction, but it takes time for the body to adapt.\n\nIf you ascend too quickly, the body does not have time to adapt properly. This can cause symptoms like headaches, nausea, severe fatigue, loss of appetite or sleep disturbances. These signs indicate the body is struggling with altitude.\n\nPreparation therefore starts with a fundamental rule: ascending slowly is not a choice—it's a necessity." },
        "slow-pace": { "title": "Adopt a slow, steady pace", "content": "On Kilimanjaro one rule applies to everyone without exception: \"pole pole\", which means to walk slowly. This pace conserves energy and improves oxygenation of the muscles and brain.\n\nEven very fit people must accept this slowness. Altitude makes no distinction between an athlete and a beginner. Walking too fast increases the risk of acute mountain sickness and reduces recovery capacity.\n\nA slow, steady pace maintained day after day is one of the most effective factors for safely reaching the summit." },
        "choose-itinerary": { "title": "Choose an itinerary that aids acclimatization", "content": "Preparing for altitude starts before you set foot on the mountain. The choice of itinerary is essential. Some Kilimanjaro routes offer a more gradual ascent and include acclimatization days or climbs, helping the body adapt more effectively.\n\nSpending more nights at altitude helps the body produce more red blood cells, improving oxygen transport in the blood. A good local guide adapts the itinerary to the group's level, pace, and reactions." },
        "hydrate-eat": { "title": "Stay hydrated and eat well", "content": "At altitude the body dehydrates faster, even when thirst is low. Drinking regularly throughout the day is essential to support acclimatization and limit negative effects of altitude.\n\nA balanced diet rich in carbohydrates provides the energy needed for the effort and helps the body manage reduced oxygen. Eating enough, even without appetite, is an integral part of altitude preparation." },
        "listen-guide": { "title": "Listen to your body and communicate with the guide", "content": "Everyone reacts differently to altitude. Some adapt quickly, others need more time. It's therefore essential to listen to your body's signals and inform the guide as soon as unusual symptoms appear.\n\nQuick communication allows pace adjustments, preventive measures and, if necessary, avoids more serious complications. An experienced local guide monitors the group's health daily and acts before situations worsen." },
        "guide-tip": { "title": "Guide tip 🏔️", "content": "On Kilimanjaro, altitude is not to be challenged. Those who respect it, walk slowly and listen to their body, reach higher and more calmly." }

        "overview": { "title": "Overview", "content": "Choosing the right hiking boots for Kilimanjaro is essential. The mountain covers many climates and terrains. Poorly chosen boots can cause pain, blisters or injury and jeopardise summit success. Well-chosen boots provide comfort, stability and protection. As a local guide, I often see poorly chosen footwear cause unnecessary suffering or abandonment during climbs." },
        "terrain": { "title": "Adapt shoes for Kilimanjaro’s varied terrain", "content": "Kilimanjaro is not a simple walk. Trails pass through humid forest, dry volcanic slopes, rocky scree and cold near-summit zones. Boots must provide grip, protection and stability. Soles need reliable traction for muddy, slippery or dusty conditions depending on the season." },
        "high-cut": { "title": "Why high-cut hiking boots", "content": "High-cut boots are strongly recommended for Kilimanjaro. They support the ankle, reducing sprain risk, notably on long descents. Ankle support becomes crucial as fatigue sets in and terrain becomes uneven. High-cut boots also offer better protection from cold and rubbing." },
        "comfort": { "title": "Comfort first", "content": "On Kilimanjaro the priority is endurance, not speed. Boots must be comfortable for long walking days, often over six hours. Choose boots that fit your foot shape and provide toe-box space — feet swell with exertion and altitude. Tight boots cause blisters, black toenails and worsening pain day after day." },
        "sole": { "title": "Importance of the sole", "content": "The sole is key for Kilimanjaro boots. It should be stiff enough to protect the foot from rocks and volcanic terrain while remaining comfortable for long walks. Good shock absorption reduces muscle fatigue and protects knees during long descents. Excellent traction is essential for wet or unstable ground." },
        "waterproof": { "title": "Waterproof yet breathable", "content": "Weather on Kilimanjaro changes fast. In the forest rain and humidity are frequent, while high altitudes are cold. Waterproof boots keep feet dry and prevent blisters and infections but must be breathable to avoid sweat buildup during exertion. Balance waterproofing with breathability for lasting comfort." },
        "test-shoes": { "title": "Break in your boots before the trek", "content": "Starting a trek in new boots is a common mistake. Boots for Kilimanjaro should be tested and broken in several weeks before departure. Wear them on long hikes with your pack to ensure no rubbing or pain. Well-broken-in boots greatly reduce injury risk during the climb." },
        "season": { "title": "Match shoes to season and route", "content": "Season and chosen route strongly influence the type of boots required. In cold season or near-summit climbs insulation matters. Some routes are longer or more technical and need more robust boots. A local guide can advise the best model for the conditions." }

This is because the days are a bit cooler, there's little chance of rain, and the dry landscape makes animal spotting that much easier (because the foliage doesn't cover animals, and they're also forced to congregate around water sources).",

Don't forget a fleece as evenings can be cool. A swimsuit will be useful when staying at establishments with a pool. A hat and sunglasses will complete the essential kit for any savanna trip. For all your clothes prefer colors like khaki, dark green, gray, brown. Avoid bright colors and white. Also forget blue because tsetse flies are particularly attracted to this color.\n\nDon't forget a first aid kit containing small bandages (cuts or other), pain relievers (paracetamol or equivalent), sunscreens and insect repellents (the most effective being 5X5).\n\nAlso think about your toiletries and a bath towel even if all establishments have them.\n\nYou can complete this equipment with a good pair of binoculars like 'Bushnell legend' or equivalent, as this tool is certainly the one you will use most during a safari."

      "bivouac": {
        "title": "The Bivouac Experience",
        "description": "Taking a trip to Tanzania by opting for bivouac accommodation is a philosophy in itself. Off the beaten path, it is a true adventure favored by adventurers. It is about making a stay that brings you back to fundamentals, leaving everyday comfort behind to focus on nature. What's more exciting than pitching your tent in the middle of the savanna, in the heart of where Africa's greatest animals live.\n\nCertainly the nights can be short as they are conducive to intense wildlife activity. It is not uncommon to hear the growl of lions, to see elephants or herbivores pass a few meters from the bivouac, not to mention hyenas that may prevent you from having a restful sleep but will leave you with a memorable memory.\n\nThis kind of trip can be economical but that is not its primary purpose, it is above all to get as close as possible to nature, especially in the parks, to live an unforgettable experience. And obviously it would be unthinkable to take a trip to Tanzania by opting for bivouac accommodation without a minimum of comfort, but all this is handled masterfully:\n\nThe tents are two-person, equipped with mattresses and mosquito nets, adapted to the environment, they reflect the spirit of an exceptional safari. Camping sites have all the sanitary facilities and infrastructure allowing for a comfortable stay in the middle of wild nature.\n\nObviously, during a bivouac trip, in addition to the driver guide, you benefit from a personal chef who ensures you a hearty breakfast, a picnic lunch and an evening meal every day. When you find yourself at the end of the world, in the depths of the savanna and you see what an itinerant chef is capable of preparing under unimaginable conditions, when you taste his dishes, then there is only respect that prevails.\n\nThe bivouac is an extraordinary experience, it is for those who want to discover the country with a hint of adventure because you never know what will happen at night! It is certainly the best way to live extraordinary moments in Tanzania, which is aimed first and foremost at those for whom Adventure is a priority. Far from clichés, to do once in your life, because it is a unique experience from which you emerge enriched and humble."

This season offers a perfect balance between pleasant temperature, clear skies, and low rain risk. Trails remain passable, which makes walking easier, especially for beginners. The light is magnificent for photos, and climate variations between vegetation zones are particularly well marked. This period allows gradual acclimatization and comfortable stays in camps, as humidity is significantly lower than at other times of year."

        "title": "Ideal Season 2: late June to October",
        "content": "The period from late June to October is considered the best overall season for hiking Mount Kilimanjaro. It's the long dry season in Tanzania: days are bright, rain is rare, and weather remains stable for long weeks. Paths are dry from bottom to alpine zones, offering easier progression and excellent success rates. Temperatures, though cool at night, remain regular and allow efficient acclimatization. Panoramas are absolutely spectacular, especially at sunrise from the summit. This period attracts more hikers, but the atmosphere is friendly, motivating, and perfectly suited for a successful climb."

During this period, it often rains for several hours a day, making trails slippery and progression difficult. Visibility is greatly reduced, temperatures become more severe at altitude, and humidity prevents clothes and tents from drying properly. Days are therefore physically demanding and mentally tiring. For these reasons, guides strongly recommend avoiding this season, especially for a first ascent."

      "intro": "Climbing Kilimanjaro is a unique adventure. This iconic mountain, rising to 5,895 meters, offers an unforgettable experience crossing several climate zones — from lush tropical forests to arid and glacial zones near the summit. To succeed in your ascent and fully enjoy the scenery, choosing the right time to climb Kilimanjaro is essential.",
      "jan_mar": "January to early March is considered one of the best times to climb Kilimanjaro. During these months the weather is generally stable and mornings are often clear, providing exceptional visibility of the summit and glaciers. Temperatures are milder in the lower and middle zones, making walking more comfortable and less tiring, although nights remain cold at altitude.",
      "jan_mar_additional": "In the afternoons, some clouds can appear and create spectacular light over the landscapes, offering fantastic photography opportunities. Trails are usually drier and less muddy than in the rainy season, which eases progress and lets you enjoy the experience to the fullest. This period suits hikers who want a balance of comfort and safety; stable conditions increase the chances of reaching Uhuru Peak while enjoying clear panoramas.",
      "routes_jan": {
        "title": "Why choose Machame, Lemosho or Marangu from January to early March?",
        "machame": "Machame, often nicknamed the 'Whiskey' route, is one of the most popular options to climb Kilimanjaro. In January to early March, conditions are ideal to enjoy its varied scenery and progressive itinerary. Trails are dry and passable, clear mornings allow spectacular views, and afternoons can bring clouds that create dramatic light over valleys and glaciers.",
        "lemosho": "Lemosho is known for offering a quieter, more immersive experience. This route crosses lush forests, moorlands and less-trafficked areas than Machame while offering excellent mountain views. During the dry season, conditions are ideal: trails are firm, visibility is excellent, and morning light makes the landscapes especially photogenic.",
        "marangu": "Marangu, often called the 'Coca-Cola' route, is known for its comfort and fixed camps. This period benefits from dry trails and favourable weather conditions, together with simpler logistics thanks to established accommodation at the camps.",
        "summary": "In short, January to early March is an excellent period for all these routes. Whether you choose Machame, Lemosho or Marangu, you'll enjoy passable trails, stable weather and spectacular panoramas."
      },
      "june_oct": "Late June to October is considered the best overall season to climb Kilimanjaro, particularly for travellers seeking stable weather, excellent visibility and trails in very good condition. During these months the long dry season settles over the massif, offering ideal conditions for a long, steady and safe trek. The low chance of rain, exceptional visibility and firm trails make this season the preferred choice. Glaciers shine in the morning sun and summit sunrises become truly magical moments. This season attracts more hikers but provides friendly, motivating conditions suited to a successful climb.",
      "advice": "Finally, I always advise moving slowly, drinking regularly and listening to your body's signals. Weather stability shouldn't make you forget that Kilimanjaro is a high mountain. Take time to enjoy each stage, each landscape and every sunrise: these are often the moments that reveal why this ascent is one of Africa's greatest adventures.",
      "rain": "Between March and May, and again in November, Kilimanjaro enters the rainy seasons. During these periods the mountain changes character: clouds become heavy, humidity sets in, and trails progressively turn slippery. For many travellers, this is the least recommended time to climb because it demands more endurance and adaptation. Showers can last several hours and sometimes persist all day. Water soaks clothing and equipment, making the trek more tiring. Visibility decreases greatly and tracks suffer from mud. Despite these challenges, the rainy season has its charm: the mountain turns an intense green and there are far fewer visitors."

      "introTitle": "Introduction",
      "intro": "Climbing Kilimanjaro is an extraordinary journey: in just a few days you pass from tropical forests to alpine moorland and high-altitude desert — up to nearly 5,000 metres, where the air contains roughly 50% less oxygen than at sea level.",
      "intro2": "This rapid ascent — unique in the world — exposes trekkers to Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS), a natural phenomenon that can affect anyone, even the fittest. Understanding what AMS really is, recognising its symptoms and adopting the right responses is the key to reaching the summit safely and comfortably.",

      "what_is_ams_title": "1. What exactly is AMS?",
      "what_is_ams_1": "When we talk about Kilimanjaro we often think of landscapes, glaciers and adventure. One less discussed element, but central to the climb, is Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS). Contrary to some expectations, AMS is not a sudden severe disease — it is the body's natural reaction to a rapid change: reduced oxygen at altitude.",
      "what_is_ams_2": "Above roughly 2,800–3,200 metres the air becomes thinner, atmospheric pressure drops and each breath brings less oxygen than at sea level. The body must work harder to supply oxygen to the brain, muscles and organs — an invisible but real effort.",
      "what_is_ams_3": "Normally the body adapts gradually — a process called acclimatisation: breathing patterns change, the heart adjusts and red blood cell production increases. This takes time, and on Kilimanjaro the ascent is often faster than the body's capacity to adapt — that is when AMS appears.",
      "what_is_ams_4": "Many travellers assume AMS only affects those who are 'unfit' or inexperienced. In fact, AMS can affect absolutely anyone regardless of age, fitness or trekking experience. The rules of altitude are the same for everyone.",

      "symptoms_early_title": "2. Early symptoms — how to recognise them",

      "symptom_headache": "Persistent headache — often the first sign. Unlike an ordinary headache caused by fatigue or sun, an AMS headache does not easily subside with rest or simple analgesics. It signals that the brain is receiving less oxygen than needed.",
      "symptom_fatigue": "Unusual fatigue — even experienced hikers can feel heavy legs, low energy or general slowing. This indicates muscles and organs are working harder to compensate for low oxygen and that the pace should be reduced.",
      "symptom_sleep": "Sleep disturbance — frequent waking, breathing discomfort or faster heartbeat during sleep are signs the body is still adapting. Poor sleep quality is common at altitude and signals incomplete acclimatisation.",
      "symptom_appetite": "Loss of appetite — common but important. A marked reduction in appetite, especially when combined with headache or fatigue, is an early warning sign of AMS.",
      "symptom_nausea": "Mild nausea and faster breathing — the body compensates by breathing quicker to increase oxygen intake, and digestive discomfort can reflect altitude effects on metabolism.",

      "role_diamox_note": "However, it is important to understand that Diamox is not essential to successfully complete the climb. Most trekkers reach the summit safely without medication, provided they follow a few simple rules:",

      "quand_commencer_title": "When to Start Diamox for Kilimanjaro Climbing?",
      "quand_commencer_intro": "If your doctor recommends Diamox to prevent Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS), the timing of when you start taking it is crucial for its effectiveness.",

      "dosage_title": "Diamox for Kilimanjaro: What Dosage to Prevent AMS?",
      "dosage_intro": "Diamox (acetazolamide) is an effective tool for reducing Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS) symptoms, but its dosage must be precise to ensure effectiveness and avoid side effects.",
      "dosage_habituel": "The dosage varies depending on the trekker and medical protocol, but the most common regimens are:",
      "dosage_personnalise": "Each trekker is different: age, weight, mountain experience, general health, and medical history influence the reaction to Diamox. Therefore, it is crucial never to adjust the dose yourself. Only a doctor can determine the optimal dosage to maximize benefits while minimizing side effects.",
      "dosage_retenir": "Diamox can help acclimatize better, but it never replaces a slow climbing pace, good hydration, and sufficient sleep. Following these rules, combined with appropriate dosage, is the best way to enjoy Kilimanjaro climbing safely.",

      "conclusion_title": "Conclusion",
      "conseil_guide": "As a local guide, I always recommend discussing Diamox with a doctor before the trip. With or without medication, respecting your body and acclimatization rules remains the key to reaching the summit safely and in great shape."

      "introTitle": "Introduction",
      "intro": "As altitude increases, many hikers experience a gradual decrease in appetite, sometimes from the first days of the trek. This reaction is normal, but it can become problematic if it leads to a decrease in energy intake.",
      "intro2": "At altitude, the body works harder: it must provide energy for walking, fighting the cold, maintaining body temperature, and especially adapting to the lack of oxygen. That's why, even when hunger is rare, nutrition remains essential.",
      "conseil_intro": "👉 even without feeling hungry, continuing to eat is essential to preserve energy, physical strength, and good acclimatization.",

      "pourquoi_appetit_title": "Why Appetite Decreases at Altitude",
      "pourquoi_appetit": "At altitude, the body prioritizes oxygenation and physiological adaptation. The digestive system works more slowly, which can lead to a feeling of rapid satiety, mild nausea, or simply a desire to eat less. The cold and fatigue further accentuate this phenomenon. This is why meals served on Kilimanjaro are adapted to altitude: easy to digest, energy-rich, and spread throughout the day.",

      "glucides_energie_title": "Carbohydrate-Rich Meals for Immediate Energy",
      "glucides_energie": "At altitude, carbohydrates are the most effective energy source. They require less oxygen to be converted into energy than fats or proteins. Menus therefore prioritize:",
      "glucides_energie_note": "These foods provide quick energy, support effort, and help limit altitude-related fatigue.",

      "repas_simples_title": "Simple Meals That Are Easy to Digest",
      "repas_simples": "Dishes served at altitude are deliberately simple, without excess fat or strong spices. The goal is to avoid digestive problems while maintaining sufficient caloric intake. Mountain cooks generally prepare hot, familiar dishes that reassure both body and mind, even when appetite is reduced.",

      "proteines_moderation_title": "Moderate Proteins for Recovery",
      "proteines_moderation": "Proteins remain important for muscle recovery, but at altitude they are served in moderate quantities to not burden digestion. You often find:",
      "proteines_moderation_note": "These foods help preserve muscle mass without unnecessarily tiring the digestive system.",

      "soupes_chaudes_title": "Hot Soups: A Key Element at Altitude",
      "soupes_chaudes": "Soup is one of the most important meals on Kilimanjaro. It combines several essential advantages:",
      "soupes_chaudes_note": "At altitude, many hikers eat soup more willingly than solid food, especially in the evening.",

      "repas_fractionnes_title": "Fractionated Meals and Regular Snacks",
      "repas_fractionnes": "Rather than forcing large meals, nutrition is spread throughout the day. Snacks are offered during the hike or at breaks:",
      "repas_fractionnes_note": "Eating small amounts but regularly allows maintaining energy without causing nausea.",

      "conclusion_title": "Local Guide's Advice",
      "conseil_conclusion": "\"On Kilimanjaro, eating is not a question of hunger, but of energy survival. Even if appetite decreases, it is essential to continue consuming small portions regularly to stay strong and well-acclimatized.\""
