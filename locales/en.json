      "question2": "Where do I sleep on Mount Kilimanjaro?",
      "question3": "When is the best time to climb Mount Kilimanjaro?",
      "answer1": "Climbing Mount Kilimanjaro is safe when you travel with a reputable tour operator like Latanzanieaucourdelanature. We prioritize your health and safety with experienced guides, proper equipment, and well-planned itineraries that allow for proper acclimatization. Our success rate is over 90% for climbers who follow our guidance.",
      "answer2": "On Mount Kilimanjaro, you'll sleep in tents at designated campsites. Each campsite has basic facilities including toilets and dining areas. Our camping equipment is high-quality and designed for the mountain conditions. On some routes like Marangu, you'll sleep in huts with bunk beds instead of tents.",
      "answer3": "The best times to climb Mount Kilimanjaro are during the dry seasons: January to March and June to October. During these periods, you'll experience clearer skies, less rain, and better visibility. The weather can be unpredictable on the mountain, so proper gear is essential regardless of when you climb."

        "longDry": "That said, the long dry season (mid June to October) is considered by many as the optimal safari season. This is because the days are a bit cooler, there's little chance of rain, and the dry landscape makes animal spotting that much easier (because the foliage doesn't cover animals, and they're also forced to congregate around water sources).",
        "shortDry": "The short dry season (January to mid March) is also a great time if you like lush landscapes, love birds, and would enjoy being present for the calving season.",
