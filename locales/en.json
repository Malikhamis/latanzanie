Our success rate is over 90% for climbers who follow our guidance.",

Our camping equipment is high-quality and designed for the mountain conditions. On some routes like Marangu, you'll sleep in huts with bunk beds instead of tents.",
      "answer3": "The best times to climb Mount Kilimanjaro are during the dry seasons: January to March and June to October. During these periods, you'll experience clearer skies, less rain, and better visibility. The weather can be unpredictable on the mountain, so proper gear is essential regardless of when you climb."

      "heritage": {
        "title": "A Legacy of Dignity & Passion",
        "paragraph1": "Our founder's father was a porter on Kilimanjaro for over 20 years. He carried dreams, equipment, and hopes of travelers from around the world on his shoulders. He would set off at dawn, cross high-altitude trails, face cold nights and unpredictable weather to ensure each climb was a success. He did this with dignity, pride, and a smile, because he loved his mountain and believed in the meaning of his work.",
        "paragraph2": "At 42, he decided to step back, not out of fatigue, but to pass on this heritage. He always said: 'The mountain gave me everything. Now it's my turn to give it back, not by climbing it, but by protecting it.' It was from this vision that La Tanzanie was born.",
        "paragraph3": "We created this agency as a tribute to all the porters, guides, and cooks who make every Kilimanjaro ascent possible, but who are too often invisible. We wanted the mountain's heritage to be everyone's heritage, a shared story where each traveler and each porter contributes to something greater than themselves.",
        "paragraph4": "Today, when you climb with us, you're not just a tourist. You become part of this story. You walk in the footsteps of those who loved this mountain before you. And in return, you help preserve their dignity, their environment, and their future."

      "paragraph2": "Every step you take with us is a step toward responsible tourism. We ensure that every euro spent directly benefits local communities. We pay our teams above market rates because we believe dignity begins with fair compensation. We limit our groups because we know the mountain suffers when it is overrun. We train our teams in first aid, responsible environmental practices, and intercultural hospitality because excellence is a matter of respect.",
      "paragraph3": "We also work with local associations to replant trees, clean trails, and educate new generations about the importance of preserving nature. Because the mountain is not an infinite resource. It is a treasure to protect, a heritage to pass on.",
      "paragraph4": "When you travel with us, you don't travel as a spectator. You become an actor in this transformation. You contribute to responsible tourism that changes lives, yours and others'. And that, for us, is the real journey."

        "description": "Think safari: light long-sleeved shirts to protect you from the sun and insects, flexible pants with side pockets, Pataugas-type shoes for hikes and light sneakers for rest periods. Don't forget a fleece because evenings can be cool. A swimsuit will be useful during your stays in establishments with a pool. A hat and sunglasses will complete the essential kit for any trip to the savanna. For all your clothes prefer colors like khaki, dark green, gray, brown. Avoid bright colors and white. Similarly forget blue because tsetse flies are particularly attracted to this shade. Don't forget a first aid kit containing small bandages (cuts or other), painkillers (paracetamol or equivalent), sunscreens and mosquito repellents (the most effective being 5X5). Also think about your toiletries as well as a bath towel even if all establishments have them. You can complete this equipment with a good pair of binoculars type 'Bushnell legend' or equivalent, because this tool is certainly the one you will use most during a safari. This is what will allow you to observe unforgettable scenes in the parks."

        "description": "Taking a trip to Tanzania having opted for camping accommodation is a philosophy in itself. Off the beaten track it's a real adventure that backpackers favor. It's about making a stay that brings back fundamental values, leaving behind our daily comfort to focus on nature. What could be more exciting than pitching your tent in the middle of the savanna, in the very heart of where Africa's greatest animals live. Certainly the nights can be short because they are conducive to intense fauna activity. It is not uncommon to hear the roar of lions, to see elephants or herbivores pass by a few meters from the camp, not to mention the hyenas that may prevent you from sleeping a restorative sleep but will leave you a memorable memory. This type of trip can be economical but that is not its primary vocation, it is above all about getting as close as possible to nature, especially in the parks, to live an unforgettable experience. And of course it would be inconceivable to take a trip to Tanzania having opted for camping accommodation without a minimum of comfort, but all this is masterfully managed: The tents are double, equipped with mattresses and mosquito nets, adapted to the environment, they reflect the spirit of an extraordinary safari. Camping sites all have sanitary facilities and infrastructure allowing a comfortable stay in the middle of wild nature. Of course, during a camping trip, in addition to the driver guide, you benefit from a personal cook who ensures you every day a breakfast, a picnic at noon and a meal in the evening. When you are at the end of the world, in the depths of the savanna and you see what a traveling cook is capable of preparing in unimaginable conditions, when you taste his dishes, then there is only respect that imposes itself. Camping is an extraordinary experience, it is for those who want to discover the country with a hint of adventure because you never know what will happen during the night! It's certainly the best way to experience exceptional moments in Tanzania, which is primarily for those whose Adventure is a priority. Far from clichés, to do once in a lifetime, because it's a unique experience from which you emerge grown and humble."
